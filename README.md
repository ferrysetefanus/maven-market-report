A bonus project from maven analytics. I analyzed maven market which is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States using Power BI. Some of the stages carried out in working on this analysis report are :
- Connecting and shaping data sources
- Building a relational model
- Adding columns and measures calculated using DAX 
- Designing an interactive report.
